A 3-4 sentence self-critique memo of your project and your progress in class to this point.

I believe that I did a good job of remaking the my IIT portal. The design was built with mobile 
first in mind and I also implement CSS grids which is a hot topic the HTML world right now. 
I did this in order to future proof the site for but and I like using CSS grids. I would have 
like to do more java-script, such as putting in measure to prevent cross site xxs hacks 
(although it is better to do it on the server side but this is a front end class), 
also I would have liked to try and implement a little php. I think the project went well 
and I learned a lot about the importance of human interaction with websites.

A 3-4 sentence critique of each group member’s work on the project.

Syed Nayyer: 

There is a lot to say about this individual. Multiple times he bailed on us 6 hours before due dates when he 
said he would be there. He was using bootstrap at the beginning, I called him out on it and all he did was delete
the css link. He then denied it so I asked him to explain his code line by line and he could not. I did this  
because I need to know how his css works so there are no conflicts when we merge the style sheets. One of the 
times he bailed on us he made everyone an admin for the master repository and it took away all the forks the 
group made. All his actions that he thought were helping the group was actually making it more difficult for 
everyone else. There were many emails he never responded to as well. He also tried to demonize me in an attempt 
to make himself look innocent and me look like the bad guy but the group knows what I have been doing for the 
project so it backfired on him. Now I am having to go back and fix all the merged css because he did it without the group 
in order to make his copied code word and now I have to fix his mistakes onece again. If he was hardcoding and not 
doing shady moves like this the project would have gone much smoother.

Lara Teagues: 

The best communicator is the group. Attended every meeting and was very helpfuly with the project and orginizing 
the group. 

Dayeon Lee: 

Missed a few meeting but had excellent communication with the group and did everything that was asked of her.

Arthur Arreguin: 

Has a great knowledge of HTML and CSS. Had many contributions to the group and also helped others with their pages.
