A 3-4 sentence self-critique memo of your project and your progress in class to this point.

I believe that I did a good job of remaking the my IIT portal. The design was built with mobile 
first in mind and I also implement CSS grids which is a hot topic the HTML world right now. 
I did this in order to future proof the site for but and I like using CSS grids. I would have 
like to do more java-script, such as putting in measure to prevent cross site xxs hacks 
(although it is better to do it on the server side but this is a front end class), 
also I would have liked to try and implement a little php. I think the project went well 
and I learned a lot about the importance of human interaction with websites.

A 3-4 sentence critique of each group member’s work on the project.
